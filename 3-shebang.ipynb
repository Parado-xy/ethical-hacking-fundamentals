    "### Shebang Lines: An In-Depth Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Shebang Line?\n",
    "A shebang (or hashbang) line is a special character sequence at the beginning of a script, which tells the operating system which interpreter to use to execute the script. It ensures that the correct program is used to run the script, regardless of the environment in which it is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure of a Shebang Line\n",
    "- The shebang line starts with `#!`, followed by the path to the interpreter.\n",
    "- The typical format is: \n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  #! /path/to/interpreter\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Shebang Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   #!/bin/bash\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Usage**: Used for scripts written in Bash.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `#!/bin/bash` at the top of a shell script.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Python 3**\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   #!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Usage**: Used for scripts written in Python 3.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `#!/usr/bin/env python3` at the top of a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Perl**\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   #!/usr/bin/perl\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Usage**: Used for scripts written in Perl.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `#!/usr/bin/perl` at the top of a Perl script.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ruby**\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   #!/usr/bin/env ruby\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Usage**: Used for scripts written in Ruby.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `#!/usr/bin/env ruby` at the top of a Ruby script.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Node.js**\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   #!/usr/bin/env node\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Usage**: Used for scripts written in Node.js.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `#!/usr/bin/env node` at the top of a Node.js script.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sh (Bourne Shell)**\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   #!/bin/sh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Usage**: Used for scripts written in Bourne Shell.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `#!/bin/sh` at the top of a shell script.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Using Shebang Lines\n",
    "1. **Portability**: Ensures that the script is executed with the correct interpreter, regardless of the environment.\n",
    "2. **Convenience**: Allows scripts to be run as executables without needing to specify the interpreter explicitly.\n",
    "3. **Clarity**: Clearly indicates the intended interpreter, making it easier for others to understand and maintain the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Considerations\n",
    "1. **Path to Interpreter**: Ensure the path to the interpreter is correct. Using `/usr/bin/env` can make scripts more portable across different systems.\n",
    "   - Example: `#!/usr/bin/env python3` is preferred over `#!/bin/python3` because it uses the environment to locate the Python interpreter.\n",
    "2. **Script Execution Permissions**: Make sure the script has execute permissions.\n",
    "   - Command: `chmod +x scriptname`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "- **Bash Script Example**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  #!/bin/bash\n",
    "  echo \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
