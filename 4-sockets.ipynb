    "### What are Sockets?\n",
    "Sockets are endpoints for sending and receiving data across a network. They provide a way for programs to communicate with each other, either on the same machine or across different machines over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Sockets\n",
    "1. **Stream Sockets (TCP)**: These provide a reliable, connection-oriented communication channel. Data is read in a continuous stream.\n",
    "2. **Datagram Sockets (UDP)**: These provide a connectionless communication channel. Data is sent in discrete packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Socket Module\n",
    "Python provides a built-in module called `socket` which allows you to create and manage sockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Socket\n",
    "To create a socket, you use the `socket` function from the `socket` module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import socket\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a TCP/IP socket\n",
    "sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a UDP socket\n",
    "udp_sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `AF_INET`: Address family for IPv4.\n",
    "- `SOCK_STREAM`: Socket type for TCP.\n",
    "- `SOCK_DGRAM`: Socket type for UDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binding a Socket\n",
    "To bind a socket to an address and port, use the `bind` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "server_address = ('localhost', 10000)\n",
    "sock.bind(server_address)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Listening for Connections (TCP)\n",
    "For TCP sockets, you need to listen for incoming connections:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sock.listen(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accepting Connections (TCP)\n",
    "To accept a connection, use the `accept` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "connection, client_address = sock.accept()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending and Receiving Data\n",
    "- **TCP**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Sending data\n",
    "  connection.sendall(b'Hello, World!')\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Receiving data\n",
    "  data = connection.recv(1024)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UDP**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Sending data\n",
    "  udp_sock.sendto(b'Hello, World!', ('localhost', 10000))\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Receiving data\n",
    "  data, server = udp_sock.recvfrom(4096)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closing a Socket\n",
    "Always close the socket when you're done:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sock.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: TCP Server\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a TCP server:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import socket\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a TCP/IP socket\n",
    "sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n",

    "sock.bind(server_address)\n",

    "    try:\n",
    "        print('connection from', client_address)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Receive the data in small chunks and retransmit it\n",
